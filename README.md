# Installation
After downloading the repository, put the "affspec" folder with your main code.

## Note for CUDA (GPU) computing
The PyTorch library support CUDA computing that can boost running speed of deep learning models. 
If you have a Nvidia GPU, then you can follow the CUDA installation steps before installing PyTorch.

In our empirical experiment, CUDA runs 20 times faster than a modern CPU.

# Requirements
Python 3.6+
PyTorch 1.0+
OpenCV2


# Alternative Tools

There are lots of other open source tools for affective computing. We list the following ones for their advantages.

- OpenFace
- FEAT
